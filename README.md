        <p>Date:August 11, 2014 Age:25 City: Florence, Los Angeles, CA</p>
        <p>Ezell Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds after being shot by Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers. After his death, his parents said their son had been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, and that everybody in the neighborhood, as well as the police, were aware of this. They recalled that Ford had become more introverted and melancholy around the age of 18,[23] and took medication that made him less active.[24] In January 2017 Los Angeles County prosecutors said Wampler and Villegas would not face criminal charges in connection with the shooting.[25]</p>

        <h2>Jamar <span id="darkBlue">Clark</span></h2>
        <p>Date:November 15, 2015 Age:24 City: Minneapolis, Minnesota</p>
        <p>After an altercation at a birthday party, paramedics were called. An onlooker reported that both the paramedics and police who had arrived at the scene asked Clark to step away from the ambulance (in which his girlfriend was) and that police then stepped from their car, arrested Clark on the ground, and the EMS supervisor placed a knee on Clark's chest, after which point he was shot.[58] According to police during the struggle, Clark obtained the officer's gun, leading to the shooting by the other officer. [59] Other accounts have disputed the police's version of events, stating that Clark was unarmed and not resisting.[60] No charges were filed.</p>
